# schedule-assistant
This application aims to help the control of calendar events, informing or time of events by voice notification.

# why was it created?
I work in a home-office mode and I always have events scheduled on the agenda, and this added to a certain degree of difficulty with attention that I have, has made me late in some events, as I also wanted something to create that was really usable and that In order to practice knowledge, I decided to create this application after a request from my product owner to pay more attention to event times  :).
